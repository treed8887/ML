# python-for-applied-computing
Jupyter-based "mini" textbook for learning python for data analytics and scientific computing

## What is this?
This is a mini-textbook derived from the course notes for
CIS 161:  Computational Science at Grand Valley State University.
It is primarily designed to teach Python (specifically Python 3.x)
in the context of using Python to solve problems in data, science,
and mathematics.

## How to use it?
Rather than a traditional textbook, it is meant to be interactive.
To allow this, each "chapter" is a jupyter notebook.

### Download Notebooks and Work Offline
To download all of the notebooks, download and unpack the zip file.
To run the notebooks on your local machine, you will need to install
python3 and jupyter.  There are many ways to install python, but
[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
is often one of the easiest prepackaged python distributions to
install that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Order
This set of tutorials is meant to be worked with in the order listed below,
but you should feel free to jump around or skip sections based on
your previous experience with Python.

If you have no previous experience with Python, it is recommended
that you work up through section 10 in order.  After that, chapters
11 through 15 can be rearranged (with the exception that chapter 13 depends
on chapter 12).
