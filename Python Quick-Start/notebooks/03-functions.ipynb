    "## What is a function?\n",
    "A function is simply a grouped sequence of statements with a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decomposition:  Take a larger, complex problem and break it up\n",
    "  into smaller individual parts.  This can actually make it easier\n",
    "  to program because the goal is no longer to program the entire\n",
    "  solution, but instead to work on each of the individual pieces.\n",
    "  A single function might be one of many in the problem decomposition.\n",
    "* Abstraction:  Focus on the general aspects, ignoring the\n",
    "  individual details to identify common aspects.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## What does a function look like?\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "    # Code for the function body would go below this comment\n",
    "\n",
    "    return somevalue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is just a **function definition** (hence the use\n",
    "of the keyword `def`.  Defining\n",
    "a function doesn't actually do anything with it -- recall it just\n",
    "gives a name to the sequence of statements.  Let's look a little\n",
    "closer at the parts of the function definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name:  the name we will use to call our function\n",
    "* parameters:  the external values needed to perform the computation\n",
    "* body:  the statements to be executed\n",
    "* return:  the computed results that need to be accessible\n",

    "function_name(argument1, argument2, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the `...` isn't a technical python notation, this\n",
    "just means with the appropriate number of arguments (based on\n",
    "however many parameters the function accepts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Argument vs Parameter\n",
    "Parameters are the identifiers used inside the function and\n",
    "a way of noting the items the function expects to receive.\n",
