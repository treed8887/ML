    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and tuples, as we've seen, allow us to store multiple values in\n",
    "a single object.  Recall that these are both examples of ordered sequences,\n",
    "e.g., the items occur in a specific order.  With both lists and tuples,\n",
    "we access the individual elements using an index, which is an integer\n",
    "from $0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the\n",
    "sequence.  For instance, suppose we have the following list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "names = [\"Bill\", \"Bob\", \"Alice\", \"Sue\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "then `\"Bill\"` is at index 0, `\"Bob\"` is at index 1, and `\"Alice\"` is\n",
    "at index 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "While lists and tuples can be extremely helpful, there is often\n",
    "a need to associate multiple things with one another.  For example,\n",
    "suppose you wish to count how frequently each of the letters\n",
    "of the alphabet occurs in a certain document.  In this example, you would\n",
    "want to store 26 counts, one for each of a, b, ..., z.  With the techniques\n",
    "we know now, there are a few possible ways to handle this (listed from\n",
    "best to worst)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep track of two lists, with the values in each corresponding to\n",
    "   one another.  One list would contain the letters\n",
    "   of the alphabet.  The other list would contain the counts, so the value\n",
    "   at index 0 in the counts list would store the count for the letter\n",
    "   at index 0 in the letters list, etc.\n",
    "1. Simply store the counts in a list and assume some ordering, such\n",
    "   as assuming `'a'` is at index 0, `'b'` at index 1, etc.  This type of approach\n",
    "   is often difficult or impossible to manage fully within code.\n",
    "2. Create 26 different count variables.  This would be a completely valid\n",
    "   approach for just a couple of values, but for more than a couple,\n",
    "   this would be a very bad approach.  It would result in massive amounts\n",
    "   of repeated code and code that cannot be easily adapted to other similar\n",
    "   tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these are great options to address this type of problem, ranging\n",
    "from clunky to downright atrocious.  Instead, it'd be better to use a single\n",
    "object to store all of these counts that associated the letter with the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Idea\n",
    "Thankfully, Python has an additional\n",
    "data structure designed to solve problems such as these.  In Python, this\n",
    "is a *dictionary*, which stores key-value pairs.  Essentially, this is like\n",
    "a list, but instead of using consecutive integer indices, other values\n",
    "such as strings, tuples, etc. can be the index (or in dictionary terms as the\n",
    "*key*.  Keys can be any immutable type (technically, the key can be any\n",
    "*hashable* type, but that goes beyond the scope of our discussion).  Note that\n",
    "keys must be unique (the same key cannot occur more than once in the dictionary).\n",
    "For each key there is some *value* stored, which can be any type:\n",
    "single value, list, another dictionary, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Dictionaries\n",
    "With lists, we used empty brackets, `[]` to create an empty list.\n",
    "To create an empty dictionary, we use `{}`.  Alternatively, we can also use\n",
    "`dict()`, which is why you should never name your dictionary `dict`."
