    "# Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we have seen and written so far is\n",
    "considered *deterministic*:  it runs exactly the same\n",
    "each time and generates the same output.\n",
    "Another very common requirement of programs\n",
    "is to utilize random numbers.  This is particularly\n",
    "common and helpful as random numbers\n",
    "are fundamental to *stochastic* simulations, which\n",
    "attempt to exploit randomness in order to mimic the\n",
    "behavior of some process.  For instance, stochastic \n",
    "simulations are used to model the stock market,\n",
    "model physical, biological, and chemical processes.\n",
    "In addition, to processes that are truly random, stochastic\n",
    "simulations are often used for to approximate a solution\n",
    "to a problem that is simply infeasible to solve analytically.\n",

    "a computer to flip a coin unless we can say directly what happens\n",
    "when we flip a coin, which would then make it deterministic).\n",
    "Instead, we rely on *pseudorandom numbers*, that look like they\n",
    "are random, when they are actually not truly random.  These numbers\n",
    "are created by *pseudorandom number generators*.  There are a variety\n",
