## January 27, 1986, Kennedy Space Center

* Engineers in a heated discussion with managers and decision makers.
* A decision had to be made regarding launch safety. The discussion among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at launch, which was forecast to be 31 degrees F

## A Classification Problem

* The engineers and scientist were faced with a classification problem that night.
* Launch or do not launch?
* An important parameter they needed to estimate to make that decision was the probability of O-ring failure that day.
* The people in charge needed to make subjective choices based on their values conditional on projected temperature.  
* Subjectivity is always important in decision making.

On January 28, 1986, it was 36 degrees Fahrenheit at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  15 degrees colder than any previous Space Shuttle launch The NASA Space Shuttle orbiter undertaking mission STS-51-L and the tenth flight of Space Shuttle Challenger was launched.

## The Data

* Flight = Flight number
* Date = Date of launch
* Field = Number of primary field-joint O-rings (out of 6) that experienced erosion or blowby
* Temp = Joint temperature at time of launch
* Pres = Field-joint leak-check pressure

Note that the Challenger launched at a temperature of 31 degrees F.

```

Let's replicate the statistical analysis of
scientists before the Challenger launch. First,
they only looked at flights that experienced some thermal distress.
Let's subset the data:
```{r}
Orings.fail <- Orings %>%
  filter(Field != 0)
```

They examined a plot of these data, and then fit a simple linear
regression.
```{r}
Orings.fail %>% ggplot(aes(x = Temp, y = Field)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ylim(0,6) +
  labs(x = "Temperature (F)",
       y = "Number of O-ring Failures",
       title = "Launches with at least one O-ring failure") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

mod1 <- lm(Field ~ Temp, data = Orings.fail)
summary(mod1)
```
With a p-value of 0.568, it was concluded that temperature had no significant effect
on the predicted number of O-ring failures.... what is wrong with this analysis?

* Extrapolated outside of available data
* Not normal data - p-value not valid
* Not linear
* Only looked at flights with failures!


Let's look at an appropriate analysis, including
all of the past launches (not just those that experienced
O-ring failure!).
```{r}
Orings %>% ggplot(aes(x = Temp, y = Field)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ylim(0,6) +
  labs(x = "Temperature (F)",
       y = "Number of O-ring Failures",
       title = "All past launches") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

mod2 <- lm(Field ~ Temp, data = Orings)
summary(mod2)
```

Notice the very significant changes. 

But is simple linear regression appropriate? (Hint: Is the
response variable normally distributed?)

For a binomial response variable, we use logistic regression.
```{r}
mod3 <- glm(cbind(Field, 6) ~ Temp, family = binomial, data = Orings)
summary(mod3)
```

Logistic regression models a transformation of the
probability of failure.

```{r}
Orings %>% ggplot(aes(x = Temp, y = Field/6)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ylim(0,1) +
  labs(x = "Temperature (F)",
       y = "Probability of O-ring Failure",
       title = "All past launches") +
    stat_function(fun = function(x){
        exp(mod3$coef[1] + mod3$coef[2]*x)/(1+exp(mod3$coef[1] + mod3$coef[2]*x))
    })
```

So what was the predicted probability an O-ring fails
at a temperature of 31 degrees F?

```{r}
pred.prob <- predict(mod3, newdata = data.frame(Temp = 31), type = "response")
pred.prob
```

Thus, the probability of _at least one_ O-ring failing assuming failure is independent given temperature is

```{r}
sum(dbinom(1:6, 6, pred.prob))
```
